# swordofmoonlight
partially* open source code and resources

# *RE: potential copyright/patent issues
my schizophrenia has advised me to move new sources to a private repo at swordofmoonlight2
as a consequence it's suggested also to delete some sensitive files from the history here:
dx.d3d9c.cpp
dx.d3d9X.cpp
som.mocap.cpp
som.MPX.cpp
som.shader.cpp
som.shader.hpp
[removed with https://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/ and more may be removed in time]
I want this repo to be evidence of how SomEx works, but it's not meant for building SomEx
source code. these files are still available in the swordofmoonlight.net repo, via past
revisions, until I may startover its repo. these files were part of past downloads but are
no longer included in current revisions. I'm trying to communicate I want these to be trade
secrets for the time being, please don't try to unearth them and distributet them, if you
have copies. but keep them for safe keeping. I've put a note in swordofmoonlight2's README
that should something happen to me, I'd like that code to be visible (i.e. public domain)

my schizophrenia thinks you guys don't respect charity or transparency and SOM will fare
better if it's not open-source or made into a media player standard. I'm still interested
in making the player component a standard, for Linux especially, however. this is a common
opinion about commercial software. I'm trying to make SomEx commercial right now, as fast
as my legs can carry us. please wish me/us luck!

# on schizophrenia
I have a strange kind of schizophrenia since 2023 (early January) that's very helpful to
me in ways, including this way and in software development, and I've come to respect it,
but I don't identify with it because its style of thought is totally differernt and lateral
from my own. it's like a personal assistant in my brain kind of, and I feel uncomfortable
lacing my public identity/presence with its ideas whenever they don't suit my own identity
I don't know how many others are like me in this, but I try to keep this private as much
as possible. my own personal feelings about SOM is it should be an open media standard
and only barely commercial*, but I trust my schizophrenia because its able to outthink me
in many ways, and I owe it--and respect it--as a team (*in case I can figure out something
with From Software, its group may prefer a commercial approach to openness)
