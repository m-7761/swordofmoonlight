partially* open source code and resources

# *RE: potential copyright/patent issues
I tried to remove files from this repo with bfg (https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/keeping-your-account-and-data-secure/removing-sensitive-data-from-a-repository)
so I've made it private, along with swordofmoonlight2, which will track different versions
