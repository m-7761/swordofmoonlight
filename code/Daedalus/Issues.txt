daeTArray is craptastic

MaskSubmeshHelper 
*guarantee (ScenePreprocessor) all meshes have unique names
FindDegenerates
*mark emptied pure degenerated meshes
*elsewhere/at the end mark all faceless meshes
*if removing, mark for later scrubbing of unused mesh features
*POSITION comparison is fascile, requires global store of truly unique positions
FindInstances
*AGAIN, need global per mesh data structure that if equal is an instance
ImproveCacheLocality
*polygons? doesn't appear to support polygons (should also ignore lines/points)
PretransformVertices
*seems likes a job for MergeMeshesHelper?
OptimizeMeshes
*ignores instanced meshes. Probably just laziness?
SplitByBoneCountProcess
*faces should be clustered so to be optimally contiguous
