JSOM is a project to convert Sword of Moonlight's files into a JSON schema that is first and foremost applicable to WebGL. WebGL is an emerging 3D graphics standard for the WWW. In a nutshell; OpenGL ES + ECMAScript = WebGL.

Typical build/install scenario for the project:

gcc -DNDEBUG -Wno-multichar src/*.cpp src/*.c lib/*.cpp -I. -lstdc++ -lz -lcrypto -lpng -o jsom 

Where lib is either hard copy or symbolic link to the "Sword of Moonlight Library" project; which should be in a folder called lib somwhere nearby.

Canvas.html implements a renderer based upon the JSOM schema. You can find a more uptodate version at http://www.swordofmoonlight.net/canvas.php. Just save it as a "webpage complete" document. Though chances are it could be incompatible with the source code in the src (and lib) folder. 

If a complete object reference for JSOM schema exists, it will be found at http://en.swordofmoonlight.org/wiki/JSOM. The schema itself is not based on Sword of Moonlight. It just came to be due to the need for a schema. The title is just for posterity sake. JSOM stands for JSON Sword of Moonlight Object Model. It is technically a recursive acronym purely by happenstance -- though the model itself happens to be very recursive in nature.

$ ./jsom --help

Usage: jsom [OPERATION] [OPTIONS] [INPUT FILE]

The JSOM program converts a Sword of Moonlight input file or stream
into a JSON schema intended to be useful for WebGL applications. If not
specified the OPERATION is taken from the INPUT FILE extension. External
data such as textures and vertex buffer objects are cached in the current
directory by default. Images are taken as textures to be converted to PNG
format images consistent with Sword of Moonlight's 5bit black colorkey.

OPERATION

     One of the following:
     '--prt' Sword of Moonlight .prt file format
     '--prf' Sword of Moonlight .prf file format
     '--msm' Sword of Moonlight .msm file format
     '--mdo' Sword of Moonlight .mdo file format
     '--mdl' Sword of Moonlight .mdl file format
     '--txr' Sword of Moonlight .txr file format
     '--bmp' Microsoft Windows .bmp image format

INPUT FILE

     The input file's format must match the current operation

     If INPUT FILE is '-', stdin is read

OPTIONS

'-f, --file F'
     The output file or device F (default "-", meaning stdout)

'-C, --directory DIR' Change to directory DIR

'-z, --gzip' Compression. JSON output is filtered through gzip

     File extensions for external JSON will be json.gz

'-h, --help' Display this help and exit

'--overwrite' External files are forcibly overwritten

'--overwrite-if-newer F' Conditional overwrite

     Overwrite occurs if existing external file is older than F

'--no-external-json' Do not externalize any of the JSON output

'--external-prefix P' Prepend P to external file names.

'-V, --version' Output version information and exit

'-v, --verbose' Verbose output

     If not writing to stdout, non-extenal JSON is printed
